### UI Flow:
-- Addition of an Event(Sceham) where the user decides which attributes of the schema they want to cluster upon (dynamic nature)
-- Addition of data points with respect to that Event. These are the data points on which the cllustering happens
-- View Clusters forming in Real time
-- View individual clusters and the data points associated to that cluster
-- Allows to group data points based on dynamic attributes and lets the user visualise that on the UI using tree based graph
